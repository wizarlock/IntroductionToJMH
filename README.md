First acquaintance with the JMH library.
Here I compare the main algorithms for finding the number of primes in the range from 1 to the limit.
According to the calculations, the most efficient algorithm is the Atkin sieve, and the inefficient one is a head-on solution.
Improvement for the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm works more efficiently up to limit = 10 to the power of 6. But then a simple algorithm will be more efficient
